                          Network not as a blockchain application (such as the
                          map app on one’s smart phone), but as a blockchain
                          platform (such as the underlying development framework
                          on smart phones, which enable developers to build
                          applications on top of the platform).

                          XY introduces ground-breaking blockchain protocols,

                          model, which stand essential to making location data
                          spoofless, trustless and decentralized. Further, XY
                          has leveraged the same power of cryptoeconomics used
                          by Bitcoin and Ethereum, by introducing its XYO Token,
                          which is used as “gas” to power XY Oracle Network
                          transactions. The use-cases are wide-spanning; and the
                          potential is truly infinite. The XY Oracle Network
                          changes how trade and transactions of physical
                          products and location-reliant services take place in

                        opportunities in businesses that have established moats
                        to deter competitors and new entrants from entering the
                        market. Due to years of centralization, consolidation,
                        lobbying government officials and government regulation,
                        the biggest corporations and brokerages that rely on
                        verifying location-specific heuristics enjoy virtually
                        no competition from rivals. The end result of this
                        creates a power-law distribution curve where the richest
                        corporations continue to set themselves apart, and reap
                        fees from consumers because there is simply no other

                      <p>
                        As it stands today, consumers have no other choice but
                        to transact using brokerages and middle-men for certain
                        transactions. For instance, a used-car transaction
                        involving two parties (a buyer and seller of a used
                        vehicle). Assuming they do not already know one another,
                        the buyer and seller are forced to use a used-car
                        brokerage or service and pay exhorbitant fees because
                        there’s no other option. The alternative cost is too
                        high. Thus the middle-man brokerage continues to build a
                        competitive moat that gets more defensible each passing
                        year. This changes with the introduction of Ethereum
                        Smart Contracts and the XY Oracle Network.

                        The XY Oracle Network uses cryptoeconomics to create an
                        autonomous system that benefits the buyers and sellers
                        involved in transactions which rely on verification of
                        location (i.e. package delivery). The rules and
                        conditions of each transaction are governed by
                        transparent Smart Contracts, which are programmed into
                        the XY Oracle Network. This enables buyers and sellers
                        to trade in transactions involving location verification
                        by replacing centralized middle-men with an open,

                      Sentinel components are heuristic witnesses. They observe
                      heuristics and vouch for the certainty and accuracy of the
                      heuristic by producing temporal ledgers. The most

                  <h5>Proof Of Origin</h5>

                  <p>
                    In a trustless system, data may be lost, damaged, tampered
                    with, or otherwise corrupted. This is the core assertion of
                    the Byzantine Generals problem. Traditional Proof of Origin
                    in a trustless system relies on a private key for signing
                    transactions or contracts in a system. This works very well
                    with the assumption that the node on the network that signs
                    the data in question is physically and virtually secure. If
                    the private key is compromised, then the ability to prove
                    origin falters.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Proof of Origin (Proof of Origin) is the key to verifying
                    that ledgers that flow into the XYO Network are valid.
                    Unique ID for source of data is not practical since it can
                    be spoofed. Private Key signing is not practical since most
                    of the parts XY Oracle Network are tough or impossible to
                    physically secure, so the ability for a bad actor to steal a
                    Private Key is too high. To solve this, XY Oracle Network
                    uses Transient Key Chaining. The benefit of this is that it
                    is impossible to falsify the chain of origin for data.
                    However, once the chain is broken, it is broken forever and
                    cannot be continued, becoming an island. These are referred
                    to as Proof of Origin Chains.

                  <h5>Bound Witness Protocol</h5>

                  <p>
                    In a trustless system, a witness node can either (through
                    defect or corruption) produce false data. Invalid data can
                    be detected and removed simply if it falls outside the
                    allowed range for that heuristic. Valid but incorrect data
                    (i.e. false data) is much more difficult to detect.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Given that an untrusted source of data for the use of
                    digital contract resolution (an oracle), is not useful, we
                    can substantially increase the certainty of the data
                    provided by first establishing the existence of a
                    bi-directional heuristic. The primary bi-directional
                    heuristic is proximity, since both parties can validate the
                    occurrence and range of an interaction by cosigning the
                    interaction. This allows for a zero knowledge proof that the
                    two nodes were in proximity of each other.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This concept is called “Bound Witness”. And the XY Oracle
                    Network introduces this possibility for the first time ever
                    into the world. The implications of this will change
                    industries and the way we trade in the world.
